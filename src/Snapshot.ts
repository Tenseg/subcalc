				Traditionally, when there are delegates remaining to be assigned and
				two subcaucuses are "tied" with the same size delegations, the chair
				of the caucus will use some method of assigning those remaining delegates
				at random. These methods include coin-flips or drawing lots.
		
				In this program we accomplish the same randomness, but we do so by first
				building this "rank order" for remainders to be assigned. It is as though
				we flipped the coins before we had a tie and just said that in the event of
				a tie we will assign delegates in this (predetermined but random) order.
		
				However, since it is possible for this order to shift each time the calculation
				is run, it could be that the exact same set of counts for subcaucuses could result
				in slightly different delegate assignments from time to time.
			 
				At this point in the code, we've determined that two delegation have
				the exact same amount of "remainder". The next line of code flips the
				coin to predetermine the order in which these two delegations will be
				assigned delegates.
