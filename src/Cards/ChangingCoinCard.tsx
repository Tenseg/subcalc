					Traditionally, when there are delegates remaining to be assigned and
					two subcaucuses are "tied" with the same size delegations, the chair
					of the caucus will use some method of assigning those remaining delegates
					at random. These methods include coin-flips or drawing lots.
					</p>
				<p>
					In this calculator we accomplish the same randomness, but we do so by
					in essence, flipping a coin in secret ahead of time. The "coin" is
					really a "random seed" that ensures fair but unpredictable results.
					</p>
				<p>
					If you change the coin, this pattern of random flips will also change.
					If want the same results as someone else is getting in their copy of
					the calculator, then you must share the same coin value.
