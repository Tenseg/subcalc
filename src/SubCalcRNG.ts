/**
 * SubCalcRNG.ts
 *
 * Manages the generation of random numbers.
 *
 * Our random numbers, like most computed random numbers,
 * are not actually random, but rather "psedo-random".
 * We just need numbers that are random enough to be a
 * fair approximation of the coin flips in the walking
 * subcaucus process.
 *
 * We do this ourselves so that we know exactly how the
 * numbers were generated and can replicate the exact same
 * "random" results on other platforms or when we retrieve
 * caucus information in the future. We do not actually store
 * the computed caucus results, after all, so we need to be
 * able to reliably reproduce them in the future. This means
 * our random numbers need to be predictable and reproducable.
 * 
 * This class is based on http://stackoverflow.com/a/22313621/383737
 * but modified to accept strings and turn them into numbers.
