#  Version History

## 3.1.1 — 23 February 2019

* Prints at higher contrast without buttons and menus
* Handle the back button more intelligently
* Added version number to bottom of screen and exports
* Fixed an embarrassing type on the welcome card (you would think we could spell "subcaucus" by now)

## 3.1.0 — 21 February 2019

We've added the ability to analyze how many members, delegates, and subcaucuses were associated to given words used in their names. Want to know how many delegates are coming from subcaucuses that were formed around issues of the environment? That is the kind of question the new analysis view can answer.

Additional improvements:
* Subcaucuses sorted as they are in the calculator when sharing email, text, or CSV versions
* Improvements for accessibility
* Presents numeric keyboard for appropriate fields on Android devices

## 3.0.1 — 20 February 2019

* The yellow cards now always be placed where you can see them
* Keep the menu and the subcaucus headers on the screen even when scrolling

## 3.0.0 — 19 February 2019

Caucuses are coming up again, so we thought that we would give SubCalc some love. SubCalc has been completely redesigned and rewritten from the ground up and includes these new features:

* Save multiple snapshots of meetings
* Duplicate a meeting
* Sort the subcaucus name and members columns (thanks CT for the suggestion)
* Hide the delegates column (thanks CT for the suggestion)
* Share snapshots as text, code, spreadsheet, or a link to the iOS share sheet
* Import snapshots via link either by viewing in Safari or using the Paste clipboard option in the app
* More detailed explanations of the numbers this calculator gives you
* Quickly reset the members column for the next walk (thanks CT for the suggestion)
* Quickly remove empty rows
* Now available as a public open source project on Github

This was the first version using TypeScript and React.

## 2.0.1 — 4 February 2016

Added explicit statement about coin flips. Thanks to JB for her suggestion that we be clearer about the coin flips that happen when subcaucuses have the same remainders.

## 2.0.0 — 17 December 2015

Rewritten as a JavaScript application. Added the ability to save cacucuses.

## 1.0.1 — 4 February 2010

This version fixes a minor problem with the coin flipping process invoked when subcaucuses have the same number of people.

## 1.0.0 — 27 January 2010

Initial release as an iOS app.
